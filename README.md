# tinysearch website

This might (or might not) be the landing page for [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch) in the future.
I picture a landing page that shows easy installation instructions and easy-to-follow usage guidelines.

As you can see, this is pretty bare-bones at the moment. 
If you want to support me with building the site, go open issues or send a pull request. 

I can of imagine a similar website layout like this one:

I hope @tonsky doesn't mind. :smirk:
